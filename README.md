# News Node <br>

CIDM 4385 Final Project

The scope of this project is to create an Android mobile application which allows the user to select from a pre-determined list of topics on the first screen of the app. After selecting their topic of choice, the user will be taken to a screen showcasing aggregated news from the sources used within the application.

On this screen the news stories will be listed in rows that must include the following:

    A link to the story through the title
    A unique ID
    The date & time of publication
    The author.

Additionally, if the application is able to detect the following, we will include them in the row as well:

    A brief description/synopsis
    A thumbnail from the article

In addition, this application will have a search function that will allow a user to filter their rows of news stories by keyword as well as by news source.

We will use the Google Maps functionality within our section dediated to International News. We feel that for the users of our app, primarily Americans, showing a GPS coordinate of the town or city where a news story took place across the globe will help keep these news stories in context. We opted out of displaying this for news specific to the USA, as our primary audience will likely be able to keep up with their own country's geography.

This App will also allow a user to submit a picture from the phone's camera for a user to either be able to log in or be able to associate it to a specific news story of the user's choice. The reasoning to allow a user to potentially upload their own photo to a story is so that the user will be able to create their own visual reminders of what they thought or saw as they read a news story. This could be useful for older users who could use an uploaded photo as a memory refresher.
